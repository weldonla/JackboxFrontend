# Jackbox Frontend
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.2.

## Installation
Run `npm install` before continuing.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Admin credentials
After you've spun up the docker container, backend, and frontend, the admin user name and password will be `admin`, `1234`. This will automatically redirect you to the user list.

## Running unit tests
I really wish there were unit tests

## Sources
